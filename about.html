        <p>Hello! My name is Tom. I do computers and stuff.</p>

        <p><br>Occasionally I dabble around programming things and making websites, although I don't consider myself very good at either. I'm decently competent at things like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but not much else. I generally use Apache on Ubuntu
            to host because I'm exceptionally lazy and unwilling to learn anything "better".</p>
        <p><br>Moving away from nerdy things, I like automobiles; mostly trains. No idea why, maybe because I share my name with a fictional steam engine. Or maybe trains are just really cool. Probably that one.</p>

        <p><br>I do also enjoy taking photos of things, but nothing professional-grade; I just use my phone. You can see my photos over at <a href="https://unsplash.com/mrdnomaid">Unsplash</a> (they're licensed under CC0, so do whatever you want with them,
            literally). Lesser quality photos go to my <a href="https://twitter.com/mrDnomaid/media">Twitter</a>. I'm not a fan of Instagram.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, that's pretty much it. If there's anything you think I should add here, feel free to Tweet at me.</p>
