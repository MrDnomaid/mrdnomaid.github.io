<p>Hello! My name is Tom and this is my blog. It's a place for me to ramble about things I find interesting. Expect bad writing and long-winded rambles that make sense only to me.</p>
<p>You can reach me via email at <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.2em; background-color: #000;">tom /at/ dnomaid /dot/ co /dot/ uk</span></p>
<p>I'm still clueless as to all this PGP stuff, but you can find my key <a href="https://keybase.io/dnomaid/pgp_keys.asc">here</a> if you'd like to chat securely.</p>
