<p>Hello! My name is Thomas, but it's easier to write Tom. This is my home on the internet.</p>

<p>I used to write a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> but it's so infrequently updated at this point that I got rid of it from the menu. You're better off following my Twitter.</p>

<p>For some reason, people ask questions, so I made an <a href="/faq/">FaQ page</a> to answer the common ones.</p>

<p>If you're as techie as me, you might find some interest in my <a href="https://wiki.fishys.space">Wiki</a>, where I jot down random things that're sometimes useful.</p>
