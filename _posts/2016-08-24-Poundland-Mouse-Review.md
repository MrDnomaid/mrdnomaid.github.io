The Signalex one pound mouse is surprisingly impressive, at least for a single pound. It is an optical mouse, so it does glow red when it’s powered, however this isn’t really an issue as long as you aren’t using it in the dark or something.

Getting it working is easy, just plug it into your computer and it does it’s thing.

It’s really rather impressive, and works really well! If you have a Poundland nearby, I recommend buying it, even if you already have a mouse; just keep it as a spare.

Sadly, they do not have it for sale on their website, but you can check back [here](http://www.poundland.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=signalex) every so often to see if they do sell it there.
