Have you ever wanted those neat colours that some sites have in the address bar and multitasking? This post will tell you how to get those!

All this requires is one line of code between <head> and </head>.

```html
<meta name=”theme-color” content=”#2baff7”>
```

Just replace `2baff7` with your chosen [hex code](http://www.color-hex.com/)!

{% include image.html path="site.png" caption="My site with its neat coloured address bar" %}
