Actually, I haven’t.

After Googling something and clicking one of the top links (not the ads), I was redirected to a data URL. The page made my phone vibrate, then a popup appeared, telling me I had the chance to win a free iPhone, MacBook or iPad! Because it was the only button, I tapped OK.

At first, I thought it had taken me to Facebook, but then I noticed how it looked nothing like Facebook, and was telling me that I was a lucky winner.

I answered “I don’t know” to all of the questions, and selected the MacBook Pro as my prize.

Rather than download some sketchy APK file, the page redirected 2 or 3 times, finally stopping on an Internal Server Error.

No MacBook for me, I guess.

Knowing this was obviously a scam, I emailed myself the data URL, and visited it on my PC. It’s a frame of hxxps://s3.amazonaws.com/notificationcenter/intl/uk/6s/exp/youreawinner.htm, which looks even more unconvincing on a desktop.

The comments are clearly fake, with the exact same pictures being used on multiple sites.

After getting the error on my phone, I decided I should try on my PC. And it worked!

{% include image.html path="YOUWIN.png" caption="They only need to know my phone number number!" %}

I decided against receiving their premium messages, so I’ve not got further than this page.

I also tried with mobile data and Tor, to see if it wasn't only Virgin Media customers who can win.

{% include image.html path="three.png" caption="So it’s not just Virgin Media customers." %}

{% include image.html path="tor.png" caption="That’s a weird French flag." %}

If you haven't noticed, it just uses your ISP. It’s not as exclusive and special as it makes it out to be.

Well that’s pretty much it. I haven’t gotten any more fake popups similar to this, and I don’t really have anything else to write about this.
