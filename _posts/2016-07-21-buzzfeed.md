Almost a year ago, [BuzzFeed said that they don’t use clickbait and that they were using perfectly fine article titles](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/why-buzzfeed-doesnt-do-clickbait). Now that’s all well and good, even if it is a complete lie, but if we just search the BuzzFeed site for “You Won’t Believe”, Google returns over 5000 results, which is pretty absurd coming from a company that says they don’t use clickbait.

# Lack of proper credit:
Not only do they claim not to use clickbait when they clearly do, they also steal images from other sites with the only credit being a tiny link in a light grey font below the image that you can barely see over the bright white background.

Even worse, this link sometimes doesn’t even link to the original source, just linking to the long URL that the image is hosted at, with no credit to the original authors at all. They claim this is “fair use” even though they are really adding nothing to the image at all.

# YouTube:
Now we need to look at their YouTube channel, which includes such wonderful videos as “[7 Signs You’re An Asshole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pUaooE0dLE)”, “[I Tried Not Giving A F*ck For A Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurVP7U7m1M)” and “[When You’re Too Shy To Poop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCLNhs9oZgM)”.

Just reading those titles alone should tell you what their channel is about, but if they didn’t, it’s basically just personified versions of their usual lists and terrible articles, if you can even call them that.

{% include image.html path="channels.png" caption="The other Buzzfeed channels. Notice how many subscribers they have." %}

They have 9 channels, totalling over 25 million subscribers. The other channels are basically the same as the main channel, just with slightly different content.

# Labels:
They also sort the lists and articles into 6 cringe-worthy categories: “LOL”, “win”, “omg”, “cute”, “fail” and “wtf”.

{% include image.html path="omg.png" %}

Most of them don’t even contain what you think they would, as the cute category’s top post is “Lance Bass Is Proof There’s Hope For All Of Us”, which I doubt anyone would call “cute”.

# Conclusion
BuzzFeed is terrible and shouldn’t be making $167 million/year from the garbage they churn out on a daily basis.
