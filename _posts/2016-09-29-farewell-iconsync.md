In case you didn't know, IconSync was a service me and iiTehEpicGuy made a few months ago, that you could upload icons to. It had a file limit of 1MB so it was “ideal for icons”! The actual service itself didn't reach public eyes, only the welcome page.

Anyway, let’s cut to why I am deciding to discontinue IconSync.

# Reason 1: It’s been done before
There are already many image hosts, which don’t just restrict you to icons, like Imgur, Photobucket and many more.

# Reason 2: Lack of knowledge
I know everyone has to start somewhere, but neither me, nor Mason had the technical know how to make a service like this. The dev version is just some code we copied from some place on the internet, and it looks terrible.

# Reason 3: We just kinda… forgot it.
The heading says it all for this one. We just forgot about it. We only remembered that it existed was when I checked my TweetDeck account list thing. Forgetting about a project within weeks probably means that it’s pretty bad.

{% include image.html path="/img/posts/Farewell, IconSync/shot2.jpeg" caption="The only user-facing page. It also looks rather bad." %}

There’s many more, smaller reasons to why I’m closing this down, mainly the lack of an actual host (it was just hosted from my PC, using XAMPP), but they don’t matter.

It was fun to make whilst it lasted, but goodbye, IconSync, it’s been nice knowing you.

# Update

The domain expired, and someone bought it. No idea what they plan on doing with it, but it's currently just a parking page.
