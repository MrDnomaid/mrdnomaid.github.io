Recently moved to Opera from Google Chrome and noticed one or more of your favourite extensions wasn't in the Opera Addons store? Well this simple tutorial will show you how you can install the majority of Chrome extensions in Opera.


The first thing you’ll want to do is install the “[Download Chrome Extension](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)” addon from the Opera Addons site. You can probably tell what this does.
And that’s pretty much it. That’s right, all you need to do is install one addon.
Sadly this doesn't work for some extensions and themes won’t work, but you probably don’t need every single extensions on the Chrome Webstore to work anyway.
