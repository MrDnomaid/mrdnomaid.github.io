If you want your page title to change if you are visiting via the file URI scheme, you can just use this simple code snippet.

If you want this to apply to all pages you visit as files, put the code into a user script management extension like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

Pretty simple, right?
