I made my first Twitter account in August of 2013 with the handle ‚Äútomcar670fast‚Äù, which was also my email address. Due to my stupidity, I created a lot of weird Tweets. Let‚Äôs look at some of them.

Where better to start than my first ever Tweet?

No, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm waiting for, nor why I decided to make this my first Tweet.

My second Tweet isn't much better.

It‚Äôs a recreation of a Top Gear scene made with LEGO. I don‚Äôt know why I wanted you to watch it so much.

After a spam of YouTube-related Tweets, we find this.

I really wanted people to look at some iPad accessories.

Immediately after getting a new phone, I begin spamming my minuscule amount of followers with Britian‚Äôs Got Talent.

My YouTube channel was pretty bad.

If you didn't see it at the top of this page, this is what my account looked like back in 2015.

I mean it‚Äôs not the worst I‚Äôve seen, but it‚Äôs still terrible.

Yes.

This is the end of the amusing Tweets on my old account. Hopefully you enjoyed laughing at them as much as I did finding them.

I might do another one of these for old Tweets from my current account, but most of the fun ones also contain personal information, so I probably won‚Äôt.
