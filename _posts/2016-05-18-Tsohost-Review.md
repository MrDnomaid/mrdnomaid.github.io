*This review didn’t come out as well as I had hoped, but it’s here. I also know I’ve only been with them for a couple of months, so I can’t really make too many concrete statements; I’ll make a follow-up review towards the end of the year if I deem it necessary. Anyway, the review is below.*

# Story
Before switching to this website, I was at diamondpigman.com, which was a free WordPress.com blog that I started in 2014, but as 2016 grew nearer, I realised that I needed much more customisation options and more flexibility, so I decided — after looking at other CMS systems — that I should use the “self-hosted” version of WordPress on my own server.

The first hosting service I looked at was BlueHost, as I know lots of sites that use them, however they are pretty expensive for what you get. Because of this, I Googled even more and found HostGator. They took my payment, but they wouldn’t let me access any of what I paid for, then wouldn’t let me refund it. Yeah. Not great, but luckily I got the cheapest plan they had and was able to cancel via PayPal. Continuing my search, I somehow stumbled upon Tsohost, and I thought they were really great (and cheap) and from the reviews I found they seemed pretty cool.

# Setting up
For me, setting up what I needed was really straightforward and only required me to press a single button to install WordPress. Finding my WordPress admin credentials was easy to do as well, and only required [searching their knowledge base](https://www.tsohost.com/knowledge-base/search?q=WordPress%20password) and finding [this video](https://youtu.be/Je13Djdauu0).

# Speed
The site has been pretty fast, at least since I installed the WP Super Cache plugin and put my site on CloudFlare. Pingdom lists the load time as 1.36 seconds (from Sweden), which is fine for me, but I could probably improve it somehow.

# Reliability

The site has only gone down a couple of times and all downtime has been under 15 minutes (maybe because UptimeRobot checks every 5 minutes), which I find pretty impressive.

Below is a screenshot from UptimeRobot that shows the downtimes.

# Value

Pretty good value, they offer somewhat flexible plans and 4 regular ones that are really great value, at least in my eyes.

# Managing
I was a bit sceptical when I learned Tsohost use their own proprietary panel for managing your site, but once I got used to it, I found that it works really well and I haven’t found anything wrong with it so far.

They also have a second “panel” to manage customer info, payment, etc.

# Support
Every support ticket and email I’ve sent has been replied to within 12 hours. (That’s fast!) Haven’t needed to call yet, but I assume it’s as good as email.
