The Signalex one pound mouse is surprisingly impressive, at least for a single pound. It is an optical mouse, so it does glow red when it’s powered, however this isn’t really an issue as long as you aren’t using it in the dark or something.

Getting it working is easy, just plug it into your computer and it does its thing.

It’s really rather impressive that you can buy something like this for a quid! If you have a Poundland nearby, you may as well pick one up to have as a spare.

Sadly, they do not have it for sale on their website, but you can check back [here](http://www.poundland.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=signalex) every so often to see if they do sell it there.
