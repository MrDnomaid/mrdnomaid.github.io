**Step 1:** Make sure the extension cord is plugged in. You can use this tutorial I wrote a few years ago if you don’t know how to do this.

**Step 2:** Locate the plug for the device you would like to plug in. Make sure its lead reaches the extension cord.

**Step 3:** Gently insert the plug into the socket(s) provided on the extension cord. Ensure the prongs are in all the way before turning on your device.

**Step 4:** If your extension cord (and/or the socket it’s plugged into) has a switch, put it in the on position.

**Step 5:** You should be done! If not, follow the troubleshooting step below.

### Troubleshooting


** The product I plugged in does not work:** Make sure the plug is inserted all the way in the socket, the power is turned on and that the device actually works.

### Tip


Remember that you are running multiple devices from one outlet; Don’t plug too many high power things into the extension cord.

### Recommendations


Purchase a cord with built in surge protection. They are not that much more expensive and will protect against minor power surges (as you could probably infer from the name).
