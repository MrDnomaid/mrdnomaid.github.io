After [discovering](https://dnomaid.co.uk/2017/youtubers-i-watch/) [Bryan Lunduke](http://lunduke.com/) last year and watching all of his videos, I realised that I should be less trusting of large companies like Google and Microsoft, so I decided I should have a crack at using more Free Open Source Software (FOSS).

I'll gloss over the details as to why (just have a watch of Bryan if you care) but here's some things I've changed:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) âž” [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) â€” While [Mozilla isn't the most trustworthy company](https://youtu.be/qMALm1VthGY), their browser is a lot nicer than Chrome and it's *all* open source, not just the non-Google bits!
- [Windows 10](https://microsoft.com/windows) âž” [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) â€” Probably my biggest change. Linux is a lot more open and a lot easier to mess around and develop with. While it doesn't run some software, I still prefer it greatly.
- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) âž” [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) â€” Google Keep was one of the hardest Google web-apps to give up, because it's just so lovely. While not designed for exactly the same purpose, HackMD works as a nice replacement for writing out my random thoughts (and this blog post!).
- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) âž” [Radicale](http://radicale.org/) & [AgenDAV](http://agendav.org/) â€” I'm not one to use a Calendar too often, so I didn't really mind the switch here. AgenDAV is a tidy web client and Radicale is a really simple CalDav server.
- [Vegas Pro](http://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/gb/vegas-pro/) âž” [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) â€” While I don't make YouTube videos as often as I used to, I still need to chop and cut videos occasionally. Kdenlive is stellar at that (as long as you ignore the buggy themes and frequent crashes ðŸ™ƒ)
- [Mailbird](https://www.getmailbird.com/) âž” [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/thunderbird/) â€” This is another change I didn't really care about. Mailbird was quite good looking, but was pretty baron when it came to features. Thunderbird does everything I could ever need and more, even if it looks like it came out in 2001.
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) âž” [OVH Mail](https://www.ovh.co.uk/emails/email-pro/) â€” Again, I don't really do much emailing, so this was an easy switch. OVH does cost about 2 quid a month, but that's fine for the extra stuff it has (using actual domains and that, *cough* tomcar670fast *cough*).

**Added Jan 21st:**
- [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com) âž” [Tellform](https://www.tellform.com/) - I don't tend to make many forms, but when I do, Tellform is my new goto. It's open source and I don't even need to selfhost it myself!
- [Plex](https://plex.tv) âž” [Emby](https://emby.media) - Plex is cool and all, but Emby offers a nicer UI (imo) and more fine control over your server settings. In my limited experience, it also seems to perform much better too.

Feel free to call me paranoid or give me a tin-foil hat, but I just like having total control over what I run.
