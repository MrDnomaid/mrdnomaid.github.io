Soon, Google’s Chrome browser is going to be marking all non-secure (HTTP) pages as “unsecure” with a crossed out lock symbol

{% include image.html path="/img/posts/How to get a neat crossed out lock for all unsecure (HTTP) pages in Google Chrome/lock.png" %}


in the address bar, but what if you want that now?

# Step 1:
Go to `chrome://flags/#mark-non-secure-as`

# Step 2:
Toggle it to be “Mark non-secure origins as non-secure”

{% include image.html path="/img/posts/How to get a neat crossed out lock for all unsecure (HTTP) pages in Google Chrome/toggle.gif" %}


# Step 3:
Relaunch Chrome

# Done
You’ve successfully enabled the unsecure padlock before it’s “officially” released.
