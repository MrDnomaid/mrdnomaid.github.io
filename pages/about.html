<p>Hello! My name is Thomas, but it's easier to write Tom. This is my (superfluous) home on the internet.</p>

<p>I used to write a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> but I'm not creative enough to keep it updated at all, so I got rid of it from the menu.<br>You're better off following my Twitter where I complain about things like an old man and autistically nerd out about trains.</p>

<p>It's just "diamond" backwards. I used to be the "DiamondPigman," people shortened it to just "Diamond" and it stuck.</p>

<h4 id="tommy">Are you Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon?</h4>
<p>No, although I think he picked a nice alias to go by. I'm also not a basketballer, footballer or politician &mdash; turns out it's a pretty common name.</p>
