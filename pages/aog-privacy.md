## All Actions

Any conversational data given to any of my Actions is saved within [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/)'s services as well as [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy)'s. There isn't much I can do about that, sadly. For more information, visit their respective privacy policies.

## Next Trains
I keep a record of all requests, including the date/time, DialogFlow Request ID and the station information you gave. Additionaly, the response the Action gives back is recorded.  

This data is securely stored in the United Kingdom and no log is specifically tied to you - no personal information is ever visible to me, and I cannot see who is requesting what.  

These logs are only used to keep tabs on which queries need to be handled better, and which stations are most popular.
