              <h2 class="question-heading"> Hello!</h2>
              <p>This is the page that tells you how to contact me, but you probably already knew that.</p>
              <p>If you're a fan and want to chat, please hit me up on Twitter instead of emailing.<br><br></p>

              <p>Before I give you my details, here's a list of things I will ignore and probably report as spam:</p>
              <ul id="ignore-list">
                <li><b>Brand deals.</b> Sorry, I don't do paid promotion. Sending me something for free in response for an honest opinion is fine, however.</li>
                <li><b>YouTube MCN invites.</b> I don't care if you're "different" or "special," just <strike>fuc</strike> go away.</li>
                <li><b>Web design/development and related.</b> I don't need a brand new website, nor do I need an app. If I wanted one of either, I'd prefer to do it myself.</li>
                <li><b>Questions.</b> Just Google it.</li>
                <li><b>Pyramid-schemes and other BS.</b> I'm not stupid.</li>
                <li><b>Generally, if you're sending it to hundreds of people, don't bother.</b></li>
              </ul>
              <p>On the flip side, here's some things I will probably respond to:</p>
              <ul id="good-list">
                <li><b>Media.</b> If you're some large-ish media company and want me to do something, that's OK.</li>
                <li><b>Questions related to my stuff.</b> I'd prefer you ask on Twitter, but emailing me questions related to myself is acceptable.</li>
                <li><b>Free stuff.</b> No matter what it is, I always like free stuff. If you want me to review it, I might, but note that I may not get around to it.</li>
                <li><b>Anything else.</b> Pretty much anything else that's not on the exclude list is fine, just don't send the email multiple times as that will just make Outlook report you as spam.</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p>Great, that's it. My email is just <code>tom [at] dnomaid [dot] co [dot] uk</code>. Do mention that you read this list!</p>
              <p>If it's something super confidential, send me an email and I'll give you my Telegram details. Note that I don't check Telegram much so my response may be delayed or non-existant.</p>

          <div class="question" id="misc">
              <h2 class="question-heading"> Misc</h2>
              <p>Sorry if this page was too harsh or made myself seem more popular than I am, but I just don't want floods of useless emails.</p>
