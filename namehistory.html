    <p><span>Pre-2012</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Thomas The Train Conductor</span><br>
      Before I had internet access, I had (and still have) a Gateway PC running Windows 98. My username on it was 'Thomas The Train Conductor' presumably because at the time I wanted to be a train conductor. This name didn't last long though, and was replaced when I created my Google account.
    </p>

    <p><span>2013</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">tomcar670fast</span><br>
    In 2013, I decided I needed a YouTube channel, but to make one of those, I needed a Google account. Originally I wanted just tomcar, but that was taken. So was tomcar670. Being the creative person I am, I just shoved 'fast' onto the end.</p>

    <p><span>2014</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">_Diamond_Pigman</span><br>
    In 2014, my friend Oliver introduced me to Minecraft. I don't exactly remember why I chose this name, but I did. This name stuck with me for many years , going through many changes; DiamondPigman, Diamond_Pigman, D1amondPigman etc.</p>

    <p><span>2016</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">dnomaid</span><br>
    In late 2015, I realised how stupid and childish 'DiamondPigman' sounded. Unfortunately, I still wasn't very creative, so I just used diamond backwards. I think it's pretty neat and much better than my old usernames.</p>
