		<p>The page you were looking for may have been deleted or moved. Sorry about that.</p>

		<p>If you expected a post to be here, try removing <code>.html</code> from the page URL. If that doesn't work, try searching with the box below:</p>

		{% include search.html %}

		<p>If you wanted a project, take a look at the <a href="/projects/">projects page</a>.</p>

	path = path.replace('.html', '/');
	document.location = path;
