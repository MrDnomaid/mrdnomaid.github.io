<p>This a shuffled list of stuff that I've made over the years. I can't guarantee the quality of things that are amazingly old.</p>


<div id="selector">
  <i class="fas fa-fw fa-filter"></i> Pick a category! &nbsp;
  <select onchange="loadProj(true, this.value, true)">
    <option value="all" selected>📚 Everything &bull;</option>
    <option value="software">💻 Software</option>
    <option value="wapp">🌐 Web Apps</option>
    <option value="wsite">📄 Websites</option>
    <option value="fun">🕹️ Fun</option>
    <option value="misc">❓ Misc</option>
  </select>
</div>

<ul id="js-list">

</ul>

<p>This isn't an exhaustive list; there's probably some things left out. You might be interested in my <a href="https://github.com/mrdnomaid">GitHub profile</a> or my <a href="https://pi.dnomaid.co.uk/pub/projects/">Pi Site</a>. They might have more stuff.</p>
