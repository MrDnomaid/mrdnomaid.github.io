<h4 id="sayhi"> How do I contact you?</h4>
<p>Check out the sidebar on the left!</p>

<h4 id="what-is-dnomaid"> What is a dnomaid?</h4>
<p>It's just "diamond" backwards. I used to be the "DiamondPigman," people shortened it to just "Diamond" and it stuck.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-say"> How do I say "dnomaid"?</h4>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://howtosay.dnomaid.co.uk/">this site I made</a>.</p>

<h4 id="lowercase"> What's with the lowercase?</h4>
<p>looks nicer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h4 id="baby-pics"> What's with the baby pictures?</h4>
<p>why not</p>

<h4 id="fish-thing"> What's that <a href="/img/fish_large.png">fish thing</a>?</h4>
<p>It's a close-up of a fish in a colouring book that was featured in the <a href="https://youtu.be/-SvYEaQRbk4?t=1025">ashens 2016 Christmas Special</a>.</p>

<h4 id="tommy"> Are you aware you share your name with the psuydonym of someone not-so-pleasant?</h4>
<p>Yes - very aware - but why should that matter? Lots of people share their names with other people; no one even calls me "Tommy" in the first place. People have seriously suggested I change my name because of the dude, and I think that's just insane.</p>
